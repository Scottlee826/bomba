============

TODO: Add small intro about the client here


Development Environment
-----------------------

The client is implemented in the C++ programming language using, CMake as a
build, and Git as a version control systems. They are required prerequisites.

The game depends on the following tools and libraries
  * Irrlicht 3D Game Engine 
  * Google Protocol Buffers

For Ubuntu Linux the standard repositories does contain required packages
  $ sudo apt-get install libirrlicht-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler


Build
-----

For Linux distributions use CMake with default options
  $ cd build && cmake . && make

For Windows it's preferred to use CMake to generate MS Visual Studio project 
  $ cd build && cmake -G "Visual Studio 10"

The binaries will end-up in bin
